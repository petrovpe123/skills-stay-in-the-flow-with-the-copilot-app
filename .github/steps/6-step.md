## Step 6: Close the loop with session history

### 📖 Theory: preserve decisions without leaking context

Session history can document what was built and where human judgment mattered without copying private source material into the repository.

### ⌨️ Activity: summarize the completed workflow

1. Use session history to summarize what you built, then remove private details and unsupported claims.
2. Identify the Work IQ skill or agent, the Microsoft 365 source type, and the MCP boundary that kept raw content out of GitHub.
3. Add one bounded future automation using the same draft-review-approve pattern.
4. Post the summary as a comment on this exercise issue.

```text
<!-- step-6-summary:start -->
Automation: daily issue triage assistant
Context: <sanitized Work IQ-derived planning priority>
Skill or agent: Work IQ
Microsoft 365 source: <Teams, Outlook, meeting, document, or synthetic fallback>
MCP boundary: <how access or transferred context was limited>
Human review: <how a person reviewed the decision>
Future automation: <bounded recurring task with an explicit approval point>
<!-- step-6-summary:end -->
```
